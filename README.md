Sales Prediction Using Python 

A step-by-step process for data analysis and building a machine learning model for sales prediction includes :

1.Data Exploration and Preparation:
- Load and understand the dataset.
* Handle missing values and data transformations.

2.Data Visualization and Analysis:
- Explore relationships between features and sales through EDA.
* Visualize data to identify patterns and correlations.

3.Feature Selection:
. Choose relevant features based on importance.
. Remove redundant or insignificant features.

4.Train-Test Split:
. Divide data into training and testing sets.

5.Model Building and Evaluation:
. Select Logistic Regression algorithm for prediction.
. Train the model on the training data.
. Make predictions on the test data.
. Evaluate performance using metrics like MSE, RMSE, and R2.
. Fine-tune the model if necessary.

6.Model Deployment and Monitoring:
. Deploy the model for real-time predictions.
. Monitor performance and update as needed.
